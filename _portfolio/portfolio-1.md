In July 2024, collaborator Justin Stevens and I were guests on Shellphone: A Breach the Surface Podcast with Harmony Dawson. We discussed river restoration in the Penobscot River and our roles using eDNA and hydroacoustic tools to monitor fish recovery in the wake of the [Penobscot River Restoration Project](https://www.nrcm.org/programs/waters/penobscot-river-restoration-project/).
