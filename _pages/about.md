Hi! My name is Julia Clem. I am a PhD candidate at the University of Maine, where I conduct research on coastal restoration and environmental DNA as part of the [Maine-eDNA program](https://umaine.edu/edna/). 

My dissertation research focuses on developing and applying environmental DNA (eDNA) tools for studying river herring and seal ecology as these populations recover due to ongoing protection and restoration efforts. I am particularly interested in validating eDNA against traditional research and monitoring methods to improve sampling capacity, minimize disruption to animals and the environment, and maximize cost-effectiveness. Iâ€™m also interested in patterns of fish and mammal community composition, phenology, and trophic relationships, as well as how eDNA can help us monitor and understand changes in these patterns. My research involves the collection of water samples all across the Maine coast, with an additional focus in the Penobscot River Estuary, as well as at seal haul-out sites in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. I am fortunate to work with a variety of collaborators at Maine SeaGrant, Maine DMR, NOAA NEFSC, and the Center for Coastal Studies, as well as other researchers and students within the Maine-eDNA program.
